### Starting the Pipeline

The pipeline starts automatically when the server boots up. You can also control it via API:

```javascript
// Check pipeline status
GET /api/training-pipeline/status

// Start training manually
POST /api/training-pipeline/start
{
  "metadata": { "reason": "Manual trigger", "notes": "Testing new data" }
}

// Stop training
POST /api/training-pipeline/stop
{
  "reason": "Emergency stop"
}
```

## üîÑ Training Process

### 1. Data Collection
- Continuously monitors new conversation data
- Applies quality filters (default: 80% quality threshold)
- Removes PII and sensitive information
- Formats data for medical AI training

### 2. Training Triggers
- **Data threshold**: When enough new quality data is available (default: 100 samples)
- **Quality improvement**: When average data quality exceeds threshold
- **Performance degradation**: When current model performance drops below 85%
- **Scheduled**: Periodic training (configurable interval)

### 3. Model Training
- Creates new model version
- Trains using selected provider (OpenAI, Azure, local)
- Monitors training progress
- Validates training completion

### 4. Model Evaluation
- Runs automated test suite (emergency, appointment, symptom scenarios)
- Evaluates medical safety and appropriateness
- Generates performance scores and recommendations
- Creates detailed evaluation reports

### 5. Model Deployment
- Deploys to staging environment first
- Runs post-deployment tests
- Monitors performance metrics
- Auto-promotes to production if configured

## üìà Monitoring & Alerts

### Real-time Metrics
- Training progress and status
- Model performance scores
- Deployment health and metrics
- System resource usage

### Alerts & Notifications
- Training failures or issues
- Model performance degradation
- Deployment problems
