ReddyTalk.ai is an intelligent voice-based medical receptionist system that handles appointment scheduling, patient inquiries, and clinic operations using Azure AI services and ElevenLabs voice synthesis. Built for healthcare clinics to provide 24/7 professional phone support with human-like AI conversations.

## 🚀 Quick Start MVP

### 1. Clone & Install
```bash
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd reddytalk
npm install
```

### 2. Configure Azure Services
Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and add your Azure credentials:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

**Required Azure Services:**
- **Azure Cognitive Services (Speech)** - For voice processing
- **Azure OpenAI Service** - For intelligent conversations
- **Azure Communication Services** - For phone calls (optional)

See [SETUP_AZURE.md](SETUP_AZURE.md) for detailed Azure setup guide.

### 3. Start the Server
```bash
# Development mode with auto-restart
npm run dev

# Production mode
npm start
```

Server runs on http://localhost:8081

### 4. Test the System
```bash
# Test voice pipeline components
npm run test:pipeline

# Test individual endpoints
curl http://localhost:8081/api/test/components
```

## 🏗️ Architecture

### Voice Processing Pipeline
```
📞 Phone Call → 🎤 Speech-to-Text → 🧠 AI Processing → 🔊 Text-to-Speech → 📞 Response
                    (Azure STT)       (Azure OpenAI)      (Azure TTS)
```

### Core Components

1. **VoiceEngine** (`src/core/VoiceEngine.js`)
   - Main orchestrator for voice processing
   - Handles WebSocket connections and audio streams

2. **VoicePipeline** (`src/core/VoicePipeline.js`)
   - Complete processing pipeline integration
   - Real-time latency monitoring (<500ms target)

3. **Azure Services Integration**
   - **Speech-to-Text**: `src/services/voice/AzureSpeechToText.js`
   - **Azure OpenAI**: `src/services/ai/AzureOpenAI.js`
   - **Text-to-Speech**: `src/services/voice/AzureTextToSpeech.js`
   - **VoIP/Telephony**: `src/services/telephony/AzureCommunicationVoIP.js`

4. **Medical Knowledge Base** (`src/services/ai/MedicalKnowledgeBase.js`)
   - Complete clinic information (doctors, services, hours)
   - Sample conversations and training data
   - Insurance and appointment management

## 🧪 Testing & Development

{"type": "start"}
{"type": "stop"}
{"type": "status"}
```

### MCP (Model Context Protocol) Server
```bash
# Start MCP server
npm run mcp:start

# Test MCP resources
npm run mcp:test
```

## 📊 Performance Targets

- **Voice Response Latency**: <500ms end-to-end
- **Concurrent Calls**: 10,000+ simultaneous
- **Uptime**: 99.9%
