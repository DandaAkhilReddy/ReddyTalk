# H1B Visa Compliance Guide for ReddyTalk LLC Formation

## Executive Summary
As an H1B visa holder looking to launch ReddyTalk, you can legally form a single-member LLC, but strict compliance requirements apply. You must maintain passive ownership and cannot actively manage day-to-day operations without risking visa status revocation.

## Key Legal Requirements

### ✅ **What You CAN Do:**
- **Form an LLC**: H1B holders can legally establish and own 100% of an LLC
- **Passive Investment**: Maintain ownership as a passive investor only
- **Receive Passive Income**: Earn dividends or investment returns (must be secondary to H1B salary)
- **Make Strategic Decisions**: Participate in high-level business decisions as an owner
- **Hire Management**: Employ U.S. citizens/green card holders to run operations

### ❌ **What You CANNOT Do:**
- **Active Management**: Cannot manage day-to-day operations, hire/fire employees, or act as CEO
- **Direct Employment**: Cannot draw salary from the LLC or be employed by it
- **Operational Work**: Cannot perform any work activities for the LLC
- **Primary Income Source**: LLC income cannot exceed or replace H1B salary

## 2024 Policy Updates

### H1B Self-Sponsorship Option
- **New USCIS Policy**: H1B startup founders can now self-sponsor their visa under their own company
- **Eligibility Criteria**: Must meet specific USCIS requirements for self-sponsorship
- **Recommendation**: Consult immigration attorney to explore this pathway for ReddyTalk

### Business Structure Alternatives

#### Single-Member LLC (Current Consideration)
- **Pros**: Simpler formation, tax pass-through benefits
- **Cons**: Owners often considered "self-employed," which conflicts with H1B regulations
- **Risk Level**: Medium-High for active involvement

#### C-Corporation (Recommended Alternative)
- **Pros**: Allows founder to be hired as employee, separate legal identity
- **Cons**: More complex formation and tax implications
- **Risk Level**: Lower for H1B compliance
